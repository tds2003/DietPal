    <h1>Gain Weight</h1>
    

    <div>
        What is Maintainance Calories?<br><br>
        Maintenance calories are precisely the number of calories your body needs to support energy expenditure.
        By eating your maintenance calories and exercising the same way you shouldn't lose or gain weight.<br><br>
        Now it is okay with maintainance calories, but whether do someone gain weight if thet consume amount of calories per day that is equal 
        to their maintainanace calories?<br<br>
        The Answer is NO.<br<br> WHY?<br><br>If a person can maintain his/her body weight by consuming the amount of calories that is equal to their 
        maintainance calories then absolutely the person has to maximize their calorie intake to gain weight.<br><br>Now here comes Calorie Surplus.<br><br>
        Now what is Calorie Surplus ?<br><br>
        Calories are the units of energy you get from foods and beverages, and when you consume more calories than you burn, you achieve a calorie surplus.
        Though calorie calculators provide a good idea of your maintenance calorie needs, you can get a more precise number by tracking your calorie intake and weight for 10 days.<br><br>
        Now let us list down the steps to bulk up the weight:<br><br>
        1. SETTING UP YOUR CALORIES:<br>
        Your weight may fluctuate day to day, but if your weight has otherwise remained stable over the 10 days, the average number of calories you consumed per day is a better representation of your maintenance calories.<br><br>
        2. STARTING POINT TO BULK UP:<br>
        Experts recommend consuming 10–20% above your daily weight maintenance calorie needs during the bulking phase for an average weight gain of 0.25–0.5% of your body weight per week.
        If someone consumes more than 30% of your maintainance calories then they will be gaining more body fat percentage in their body. To avoid this 
        experts recommend to follow a lean bulking process rather than dirty bulk. 
        After that if the weight does not increase further then either the person has to further increse the daily
        calorie consumption or decrease the cardio sessions. <br>
        <br>
        What is Dirty Bulk?
        <br>
        Dirty Bulking is a process of gaining weight by putting themselves into calorie surplus more than that needed for a lean bulk.
        Just as many people find it difficult to lose weight, others find it hard to gain weight.

For these individuals, a dirty bulk may be a helpful tool, as it usually promotes a significant calorie surplus and thus leads to weight gain.<br><br>
3. SPLITTING UP OUR MACROS:<br>
According to fitness science'<br>

45–60% of your calories must be filled up with carbs.
30–35% of your calories must be filled up with protein.
15–30% of your calories must be filled up with fat.
<br><br>
4.TRAINING AND CARDIO:<br>
As you gain weight, your maintenance calories will increase over time, and you will need to adjust your calorie intake based on your weight gain goals.When bulking, it’s easy to eat high calorie, nutrient-poor foods like desserts or fried foods to rapidly achieve a calorie surplus. Yet, healthy bulking is possible as long as you focus on nutrient-dense foods.
Cardio is important for everyone to increase their stamina. So it doesn't mean that no cardio is required when someone is on a bulk.
<br><br>
        5.TRACK YOUR PROGRESS:<br>
        Four things that everyone needs to track during their weightloss journey are,<br>
        * Your calorie intake.<br>
        * Your protien intake.<br>
        * Calories burned.<br>
        * Track your body weight. Use the same scale, at the same time of day, and wearing the same clothes.
        <br><br>
        6. CONSISTENCY:<br>
        This is the last and final step. Consistency is the key to achieve something you want. <br><br>
        There are so many rumors about supplements:<br>
        To make that clear, first everyone has to know what is supplement and why do we use supplements.<br><br>
        WHAT IS SUPPLEMENT?<br>
        Something that is added to something else.<br>
        Without a proper diet and workout game plan it is not possible for someone to trnasform to their dream body just by consuming any supplements.
        Supplements are something that helps you to fulfill your diet. <br><br>
        Now let us say,<br>
        *Person-A has to consume 150gms of protien per day but he was able to consume only 120gms protien by means of food.<br><br>

        Then the person would consume remaining 30gms of protien through any protien supplements.<br><br>
        Therefore no one can trnasform their body by only consuming supplements. Supplements are just an helping factor added to a proper diet and workout.
