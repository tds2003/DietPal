        What is Maintainance Calories?<br><br>
        Maintenance calories are precisely the number of calories your body needs to support energy expenditure.
        By eating your maintenance calories and exercising the same way you shouldn't lose or gain weight.<br><br>
        Now it is okay with maintainance calories, but whether do someone lose weight if thet consume amount of calories per day that is equal 
        to their maintainanace calories?<br<br>
        The Answer is NO.<br<br> WHY?<br><br>If a person can maintain his/her body weight by consuming the amount of calories that is equal to their 
        maintainance calories then absolutely the person has to minimize their calorie intake to lose weight.<br><br>Now here comes Calorie Deficit.<br><br>
        Now what is Calorie Deficit?<br><br>
        Calories are the units of energy you get from foods and beverages, and when you consume fewer calories than you burn, you achieve a calorie deficit.
        Though calorie calculators provide a good idea of your maintenance calorie needs, you can get a more precise number by tracking your calorie intake and weight for 10 days.<br><br>
        Now let us list down the steps to cut down the weight:<br><br>
        1. SETTING UP YOUR CALORIES:<br>
        Your weight may fluctuate day to day, but if your weight has otherwise remained stable over the 10 days, the average number of calories you consumed per day is a better representation of your maintenance calories.<br><br>
        2. STARTING POINT TO CUT DOWN:<br>
        One can start his/her weightloss journey by reducing 500 calories from their maintainance calories. After one reduces his calories by 500, the person can 
        notice that their weight has lost to some small extent. After that if the weight does not get reduced further then either the person has to further reduce the daily
        calorie consumption or increase the cardio sessions. 

    <br><br>
        3.SPLITTING UP OUR MACROS:<br>
        According to the fitness science,<br> 
        30% of our calories must be filled up with Protien.<br>
        25% of our calories must be filled up with Fats.<br>
        45% of our calories must be filled up with Carbs.
        <br><br>
        4.TRAINING AND CARDIO:<br>
        As you lose weight, your maintenance calories will decrease over time, and you will need to adjust your calorie intake based on your weight loss goals.
        Still, to ensure healthy weight loss and adequate nutrient intake, women should not consume fewer than 1,200 calories per day, and men no fewer than 1,500 calories 
        <br>
        Since one cant reduce his/her calories over a limit, they can increase their cardio sessions accordingly.<br><br>
        5.TRACK YOUR PROGRESS:<br>
        Four things that everyone needs to track during their weightloss journey are,<br>
        * Your calorie intake.<br>
        * Your protien intake.<br>
        * Calories burned.<br>
        * Track your body weight. Use the same scale, at the same time of day, and wearing the same clothes.
        <br><br>
        6. CONSISTENCY:<br>
        This is the last and final step. Consistency is the key to achieve something you want. <br><br>
        There are so many rumors about supplements:<br>
        To make that clear, first everyone has to know what is supplement and why do we use supplements.<br><br>
        WHAT IS SUPPLEMENT?<br>
        Something that is added to something else.<br>
        Without a proper diet and workout game plan it is not possible for someone to trnasform to their dream body just by consuming any supplements.
        Supplements are something that helps you to fulfill your diet. <br><br>
        Now let us say,<br>
        *Person-A has to consume 150gms of protien per day but he was able to consume only 120gms protien by means of food.<br><br>

        Then the person would consume remaining 30gms of protien through any protien supplements.<br><br>
        Therefore no one can trnasform their body by only consuming supplements. Supplements are just an helping factor added to a proper diet and workout.
