        What Is a Calorie?<br><br>
A calorie is an exact unit of energy, specifically,
 it is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram (g) of water by 1 degree Celsius. The “calories” in food are actually kilocalories, or 1,000 of these tiny units. Fats are the most calorie-dense foods we eat, 
 with about 9 kilocalories (kcal) per gram. Carbohydrates and protein each have about 4 kcal per gram. On the most basic level, eating fewer calories than you burn will result in weight loss. <br><br>What are High-Calorie-Dense Foods?<br><br>
High-Calorie-dense foods are foods that contain high amounts of calories relative to their weight.These kinds of foods can be consumed to gain weight.<br><br>What are Low-Calorie-Dense Foods?<br><br>
Low-Calorie-dense foods are foods that contain less amounts of calories relative to their weight. These kinds of foods can be consumed to lose weight.<br><br>Therefore calories are the important factor that you must concentrate
on if one has to achieve their dream body.
